/**
 * Regression: a result that is a genuine QUESTION back to the user must be parked
 * on `wait-input`, NOT handed to the next brain — EVEN when the optional LLM
 * quality verifier is enabled.
 *
 * The LLM verifier is contractually told to FAIL any result that "does not
 * actually address the task" (see buildVerifierPrompt), which is exactly what a
 * request-for-input looks like. Before the fix, verifyReportedCompletion ran the
 * full verifier (deterministic + LLM) and only inspected the result for an input
 * request when the verdict was ok — so an enabled LLM gate turned every question
 * into a handover and stranded it. The fix gives input-request detection
 * precedence over the LLM gate (but still after the deterministic failure gate).
 *
 * We stub `llmVerdict` to force a FAIL so the test is deterministic and does not
 * spawn a real verifier CLI.
